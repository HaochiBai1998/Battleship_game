//Task 21. Checking for win/lose

We really are only checking if a player has lost (Player A wins if Player B loses).
The rules for this are that a player loses if all their ships have sunk.

You have almost all the pieces you need for this, and should be getting pro
at this by now, so we're just going to let you do this part on your own :)
